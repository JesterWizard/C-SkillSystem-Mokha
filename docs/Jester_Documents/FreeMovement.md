## 🧩 Introduction

This feature enables **free movement**, allowing units to move around the map in a style similar to traditional **JRPG overworld movement**, rather than being restricted to their standard Fire Emblem movement range.

This fork includes the **ASM Sme** implementation of free movement by default.

## 🚀 How To Use

Free movement can be enabled from any `.c` or `.h` file that includes:

```c
#include "jester_headers/custom-functions.h"
```

To enable it in a chapter, simply add the following to your starting event:

Once called, the player gains control of free movement for the active unit.

## 🐛 Limitations & Bugs

Please be aware of the following limitations:

- Free movement disables itself after saving and suspending a chapter

- Only the first deployed unit is supported — do not attempt to activate free movement for multiple units simultaneously

- You cannot interact with enemies to initiate combat, nor can you use standard commands like Trade, Rescue, etc. while in free movement mode
